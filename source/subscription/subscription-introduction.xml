  <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
  <p>
    This document contains information about the <code>Subscription</code> resource and details specific to options in it.  See <a href="subscriptions.html">Subscriptions</a> for general information about using Subscriptions in FHIR.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>Subscription</code> resource is used to establish proactive event notifications from a FHIR server to another system.  Subscribers request event notifications within a predefined <a href="subscriptiontopic.html">SubscriptionTopic</a> that the server supports, and can further refine their notifications by supplying filters. Each <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resource defines a set of allowed filters (<code>SubscriptionTopic.canFilterBy</code>), which a subscriber refer to within a <code>Subscription</code> resource (<code>Subscription.filterBy</code>).  Once a subscription is created, any event matching a specified SubscriptionTopic that meets the filtering criteria will cause a notification to be sent using the provided channel.  Notifications are <a href="bundle.html#subscription-notification">Bundle</a> resources, of type <code>subscription-notification</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subscriptions are active resources; a server can only accept a subscription
    if it will execute the specified channel for any resources subsequently
    received. The subscription is no longer active once it is deleted from
    the server.
  </p>
  <p>
    By adjusting <code>Subscription.content</code>, subscribers can request event notifications that include full resource content; or just the ID of the triggering resource; or an empty notification body.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several channels are defined in the core specification:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#rest-hook"><b>rest-hook</b></a>: Notifications are sent via HTTPS POST to the <code>Subscription.endpoint</code> URL (e.g., <code>https://...</code>)</li>
    <li><a href="#websockets"><b>websocket</b></a>: Notifications are sent via WS/S to a client connected via a WebSocket</li>
    <li><a href="#email"><b>email</b></a>: Notifications are sent via SMTP/S, S/MIME, or Direct SMTP to the <code>Subscription.endpoint</code> email URI (e.g., <code>mailto:...</code>)</li>
    <li><a href="#messaging"><b>message</b></a>: Notifications are sent via <a href="messaging.html">FHIR messaging</a> to the application identified in the <code>Subscription.endpoint</code> URI</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additional channel types can be <a href="#channel-extending">defined</a> by external implementation guides.
    See below for further discussion of the various channels.

  <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>Subscription</code> resource is used in the <a href="subscriptions.html">Subscriptions Framework</a>.  Information about the Boundaries and Relationships both within the Subscriptions Framework and to other areas of the FHIR specification can be found <a href="subscriptions.html#bnr">here</a>.

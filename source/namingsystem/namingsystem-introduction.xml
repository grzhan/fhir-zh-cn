<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
Defines a specific code system or identifier system, so that it can be noted in a registry for other systems to find and understand an identifier.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
A <code>NamingSystem</code> resource manages identifiers of a code system or identifier system, identifier metadata (e.g. type), and limited code system or identifier system specific metadata (e.g. publisher and description).
A <code>CodeSystem</code> resource represents a code system, its key properties, and may include the content, identifiers, and other metadata.   
There is known overlap between the <code>CodeSystem</code> and <code>NamingSystem</code> resource elements. However, the key differences between the resources are as follows:
<ul>
  <li><code>CodeSystem</code> resources may include the concept and property content of the code system, whereas <code>NamingSystem</code> resources do not. <code>CodeSystem</code> resources also allow identifiers to be supplemented by specific metadata. The metadata are supported with extensions.</li>
  <li><code>NamingSystem</code> resources allow the identifiers for code systems or identifier systems to be supplemented by metadata specific to the identifiers. For example: preferred, authoritative, and validity period.</li>
</ul>
